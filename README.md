## Introduction
The ICC Men's T20 World Cup is a cricket tournament played between various teams. In this project, I embarked on a journey to harness the power of data analytics to provide strategic guidance to form a team composition and match-winning strategies.

## Key Highlights
• **Data Gathering:** I performed web scraping to collect extensive data on players' information and stored it in a json file.

• **Data Cleaning:** I cleaned and preprocessed the acquired data, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

• **Data Transformation & Data Modeling:** I transformed the raw data into a structured format, as well as I created relationships between various tables in order to connect them with each other making it ready for in-depth analysis.

• **Dashboard Creation:** I created dashboards that effectively communicated critical insights to stakeholders. These dashboards were designed to be user-friendly, allowing for easy interpretation of complex cricket statistics.

## Insights Derived
• **Top Power Hitters/Openers :** Identified the most explosive batsmen in the tournament, crucial for setting high run targets.

• **Top Anchors/Middle Order:** Recognized players who provided stability and maintained the innings during crucial phases.

• **Top Finishers/Lower Order :** Highlighted batsmen with a knack for finishing games effectively under pressure.

• **Top All-rounders:** Identified versatile players who excelled both with the bat and ball, adding a dynamic dimension to the team.

• **Top Fast Bowlers:** Recognized the leading wicket-takers and most economical bowlers, pivotal for restricting the opposition's scoring.

## Playing 11 Selection
One of the project's key outcomes was the creation of a formidable Playing 11 team. This selection was meticulously crafted, taking into account the top-performing players from the aforementioned categories. The aim was to assemble a balanced team capable of both setting competitive totals and successfully defending them.
